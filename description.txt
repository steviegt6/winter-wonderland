Implemented:
 -Merchant replaces guide on spawn (furnace)
 -Surface is all the ice biome (evils, jungle, desert, and dungeon preserved)
 -Christmas permanently on
 -Considerably more frequent rainfall
 -Days are half as long and nights are twice as long

Planned:
 >NPCs can move in at night and arent affected by biomes

 rain (if possible, need the texture for night sky so I can add an aurora borealis)

 >Trees spawn more frequently, 1/2 chance they are a Christmas Tree (random decorations?)
 >Christmas trees can spawn in underground layer like in the jungle (maybe caverns too)

 -Desert has reskinned sand and backgrounds (I just need source files and the vanilla textures to go off of, I can do the art)
 >Same with ocean biome, but palm trees are replaced with christmas trees
 >If possible, Ocean has 1 layer of ice above it

 -Need a source file to retexture a minishark, this should only change the look and not affect
 it in any other way. Someone disabling the mod shouldnt break it
