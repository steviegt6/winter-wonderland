-Santa replaces guide on spawn
>NPCs can move in at night and arent affected by biomes

-Forest biome is replaced by snow biome
>Christmas Mode permanently on if mod is enabled
>Shorter days and longer nights (maybe half day and double night)
>Rain is more frequent
(if possible, need the texture for night sky so I can add an aurora borealis)

>Trees spawn more frequently, 1/2 chance they are a Christmas Tree (random decorations?)
>Underground layer has dirt replaced by snow
>Christmas trees can spawn in underground layer like in the jungle (maybe caverns too)

-Unaffected biomes:
>Underworld
>Space
>Jungle
>Underground Jungle
>Temple
>Glowing Mushroom
>Corruption
>Crimson
>Hallow
>Dungeon

-Desert has reskinned sand and backgrounds (I just need source files and the vanilla textures to go off of, I can do the art)
>Same with ocean biome, but palm trees are replaced with christmas trees
>If possible, Ocean has 1 layer of ice above it

-Need a source file to retexture a minishark, this should only change the look and not affect
it in any other way. Someone disabling the mod shouldnt break it
