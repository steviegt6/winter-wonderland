Implemented:
 -Merchant replaces guide on spawn (furnace)
 -Surface is all the ice biome (evils, jungle, desert, and dungeon preserved)
 -Christmas permanently on

Planned:
 >NPCs can move in at night and arent affected by biomes

 >Shorter days and longer nights (maybe half day and double night)
 >Rain is more frequent
 (if possible, need the texture for night sky so I can add an aurora borealis)

 >Trees spawn more frequently, 1/2 chance they are a Christmas Tree (random decorations?)
 >Underground layer has dirt replaced by snow
 >Christmas trees can spawn in underground layer like in the jungle (maybe caverns too)

 -Unaffected biomes:
 >Underworld
 >Space
 >Jungle
 >Underground Jungle
 >Temple
 >Glowing Mushroom
 >Corruption
 >Crimson
 >Hallow
 >Dungeon

 -Desert has reskinned sand and backgrounds (I just need source files and the vanilla textures to go off of, I can do the art)
 >Same with ocean biome, but palm trees are replaced with christmas trees
 >If possible, Ocean has 1 layer of ice above it

 -Need a source file to retexture a minishark, this should only change the look and not affect
 it in any other way. Someone disabling the mod shouldnt break it
